## Introduction
This is a repository of the programs I write for college projects and/or assignments, or just stuff that I made with other college friends.
Don't judge me lmao.

I probably wouldn't have written this but it felt empty without a readme file so, yeah.

# Programs
## False Position/Regula Falsi
The false position, or regula falsi method, is an iterative method used to find an approximate root of a mathematical function. This program does exactly that, albeit with a predefined function (user defined function is in progress)
